# Using Generative and Explainable Neural Networks to Investigate the Relationship Between Motor Cortex Activity and Animal Behavior During Motor Task Learning

These example scripts and data were used for the analysis in the article; Tanabe et al. 2024 (preprint) 'Using Generative and Explainable Neural Networks to Investigate the Relationship Between Motor Cortex Activity and Animal Behavior During Motor Task Learning'.

Example scripts <br />
ConvNet_P1: Example of extracting feature with ConvNet from reach trial video. <br />
ConvNet_P2: Example of training dense unit to predict neural activity from ConvNet features. <br />
GAN_P1: Example of training conditional GAN to generate rat video with condition of 6 neuron's activity (top R2 from ConvNet analysis). <br />
GAN_P2: Generating GAN image, save video, example plot.  <br />
