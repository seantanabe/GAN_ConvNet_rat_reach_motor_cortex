# Application of Generative Adversarial Networks and explainable Convolutional Networks to investigate relation between activity in motor cortex and a skilled hand use task. [temp title]

Example scripts <br />
ConvNet_P1: Example of extracting feature with ConvNet from reach trial video. <br />
ConvNet_P2: Example of training dense unit to predict neural activity from ConvNet features. <br />
GAN_P1:     Example of trainig conditional GAN to generate rat video with condition of 6 neuron's activity (top R2 from ConvNet analysis). <br />
GAN_P2:     Generating GAN image, save video, example plot.  <br /> 

Conditional GAN is adaptation from: <br />
